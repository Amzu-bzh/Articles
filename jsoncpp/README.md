# Article : jsoncpp

The objective of this [article](https://medium.com/@amaury-godot/jsoncpp-write-and-read-json-in-c-e5b49e0da4f7) is to explain how works the `jsoncpp` library for c++.

## Download jsoncpp
If you want to download the library, go to the repository of the [project](github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp) and download the source code. After, run the script name `amalgamate.py` who will create the `dist` folder. Copy the contents of this folder to your project and link your compiler with the include file.

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYauneigGTs&ab_channel=PlanetReview) also explains how to install jsoncpp on Visual Studio, but it also works if you compile manually.
